# 🚀 AIOS: From Zero to Execution

---

## Prerequisites: The "Ground Zero" Setup ✅

Before writing a single line of OS code, you must prepare your development environment. You cannot use standard Windows/Linux tools because they assume an OS already exists.

### Action Items

**Set up a Linux Environment:**
Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a Linux VM (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended). OS development is significantly harder on native Windows.

**Install Build Tools:**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential nasm qemu-system-x86 grub-pc-bin xorriso mtools
```
> **Purpose:** `nasm` (assembler), `qemu` (emulator to test your OS), `gcc` (compiler).

**Build a Cross-Compiler (The Hardest First Step):**
- **Why:** Your system `gcc` targets your host OS (Linux/Windows). You need a compiler that targets "Bare Metal" (no OS).
- **Action:** Follow the "GCC Cross-Compiler" guide on OSDev Wiki. Build `x86_64-elf-gcc`.
- **Goal:** You must be able to run `x86_64-elf-gcc --version` successfully.

> ✅ **build.sh** automates dependency installation. Cross-compiler guide: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

## Phase 1: The Bootloader (Birth) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Wake up the CPU and hand over control to your code.

### Step 1.1: The "Hello World" of OS Dev *(3 Days)* ✅

**Concept:** The BIOS loads the first 512 bytes of the disk into memory (address `0x7C00`) and runs it.

**Action:**
- ✅ Write a simple Assembly file (`boot.asm`).
- ✅ Use `int 0x10` (BIOS interrupt) to print a character `'A'` to the screen.
- ✅ Compile using:
  ```bash
  nasm -f bin boot.asm -o boot.bin
  ```
- ✅ Run using:
  ```bash
  qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=boot.bin
  ```

> ✅ **Completed.** `boot/kernel_entry.asm` implements Multiboot2 header and stack setup.

---

### Step 1.2: Switching to 32-bit Protected Mode *(1 Week)* ✅

**Concept:** The CPU starts in 16-bit "Real Mode" (legacy). We need to access more memory.

**Action:**
- ✅ Disable interrupts (`cli`).
- ✅ Load the GDT (Global Descriptor Table) — a map defining memory segments.
- ✅ Set the PE (Protection Enable) bit in the `CR0` register.
- ✅ Far jump to 32-bit code.

**Goal:** Print `"Hello from 32-bit mode"` using VGA memory (`0xB8000`) instead of BIOS interrupts.

> ✅ **Completed.** GRUB handles the mode switch; `kernel/gdt.c` loads the GDT in 64-bit mode.

---

### Step 1.3: Switching to 64-bit Long Mode *(1 Week)* ✅

**Concept:** AI needs massive RAM. 32-bit only gives 4GB. We need 64-bit.

**Action:**
- ✅ Set up Paging (identity map the first 4MB).
- ✅ Enable PAE (Physical Address Extension).
- ✅ Set the Long Mode bit in `EFER MSR`.
- ✅ Enable Paging (set `CR3`).
- ✅ Far jump to 64-bit code.

> ✅ **Completed.** Using GRUB2 Multiboot2 which hands the kernel off in 64-bit Long Mode. `boot/linker.ld` places kernel at 1MB.

---

## Phase 2: Kernel Foundation (The Heart) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Create a structured environment for C code.

### Step 2.1: The Kernel Entry Point *(3 Days)* ✅

**Concept:** You need a stack pointer to call C functions.

**Action:**
- ✅ Write `boot.asm` to set up a stack (`mov esp, stack_top`).
- ✅ Call `kernel_main` from Assembly.
- ✅ Write `kernel.c`:
  ```c
  void kernel_main() {
      char* video_memory = (char*)0xB8000;
      *video_memory = 'X'; // Print X
  }
  ```
- ✅ Write a **Linker Script** (`linker.ld`) to tell the compiler where to place the kernel in memory.

> ✅ **Completed.** See `boot/kernel_entry.asm`, `kernel/kernel_main.c`, and `boot/linker.ld`.

---

### Step 2.2: Framebuffer Console *(1 Week)* ✅

**Concept:** Writing to `0xB8000` byte-by-byte is tedious. You need a driver.

**Action:**
- ✅ Create `print.c`: Implement `print_string`, `print_int`, `clear_screen`.
- ✅ Handle scrolling (when text reaches the bottom of the screen).
- ✅ Handle cursor position tracking.

> ✅ **Completed.** `kernel/vga.c` implements full 80×25 VGA text driver with colors, hardware cursor, scroll, and `vga_puts` / `vga_puthex` / `vga_putdec`.

---

### Step 2.3: Global Descriptor Table (GDT) & Interrupts (IDT) *(2 Weeks)* ✅

**Concept:** The CPU needs to know what to do when errors happen (like dividing by zero).

**Action:**
- ✅ Load a GDT (Code Segment, Data Segment).
- ✅ Remap the PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) to avoid conflicts with CPU exceptions.
- ✅ Load an IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table).

> ✅ **Completed.** `kernel/gdt.c` loads 5-segment GDT. `kernel/idt.c` + `kernel/isr_stubs.asm` implement all 256 ISR stubs. PIC remapped to INT 0x20–0x2F. Exception panic screen shows fault name + RIP.

> **Test:** Force a divide-by-zero error in your kernel. Your OS should catch it and print `"Error: Division by Zero"` instead of crashing/rebooting. ✅

---

## Phase 3: Memory Management (The Sandbox)

**Goal:** Allocate memory dynamically. This is the hardest phase.

### Step 3.1: Physical Memory Manager *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** You need a map of which RAM addresses are free.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Read the BIOS memory map (provided by Multiboot2).
- ⬜ Create a "Bitmap Allocator": An array of bits where `1 = used`, `0 = free`.
- ⬜ Implement `kalloc_physical_page()` and `kfree_physical_page()`.

---

### Step 3.2: Virtual Memory & Paging *(2 Weeks)*

**Concept:** Give every process its own "virtual" view of memory, isolating it from others.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Map Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses (`PML4 -> PDPT -> PD -> PT`).
- ⬜ Implement `map_page(virtual_addr, physical_addr)`.

> **AIOS Twist:** Implement **Huge Pages (2MB)**. This reduces TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) misses, which is critical for large matrix operations in AI.

---

### Step 3.3: Kernel Heap (Malloc) *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** `kmalloc` allows you to create dynamic data structures (linked lists, trees).

**Action:**
- ⬜ Implement a simple Heap Algorithm (e.g., First-Fit or Best-Fit).
- ⬜ Define a block header (size, used flag, next pointer).

> **Test:** Allocate 1000 integers, free them, and check for memory leaks.

---

## Phase 4: Hardware Interaction (The Senses)

**Goal:** Interact with the outside world (Keyboard/Timer).

### Step 4.1: Keyboard Driver *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** The keyboard sends "Scan Codes", not ASCII letters.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Handle IRQ1 (Interrupt Request 1).
- ⬜ Read data from Port `0x60` (`in al, 0x60`).
- ⬜ Create a Scancode → ASCII translation table.
- ⬜ Implement a keyboard buffer (circular buffer) to store keystrokes.

---

### Step 4.2: Timer (PIT/APIC) *(3 Days)*

**Concept:** The OS needs a heartbeat for scheduling.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Configure the PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) to fire 1000 times a second (1000Hz).
- ⬜ Create a `timer_tick` global variable that increments on every interrupt.
- ⬜ Implement `sleep(seconds)` function.

---

## Phase 5: File System (The Library)

**Goal:** Load the AI Model from disk.

### Step 5.1: Disk Driver (AHCI/IDE) *(2 Weeks)*

**Concept:** You need to read sectors from the hard drive.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Start with simple PIO Mode IDE (Ports `0x1F0`).
- ⬜ Function: `read_sector(lba_address, buffer)`.

> **Note:** AHCI (SATA) is faster but extremely complex. Stick to IDE or VirtIO for QEMU testing first.

---

### Step 5.2: Simple File System (FAT32) *(2 Weeks)*

**Concept:** You need a structure to organize files.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Write a driver to read the FAT32 Boot Sector.
- ⬜ Traverse the File Allocation Table to find clusters.
- ⬜ Implement `fopen`, `fread`.

**Goal:** Read a text file stored on a virtual disk image.

---

## Phase 6: Multitasking (The Pulse)

**Goal:** Run multiple things at once.

### Step 6.1: Process Control Block (PCB) *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** A structure to save the state of a running program (Registers, Stack Pointer).

**Action:**
- ⬜ Define `struct PCB` (pid, state, registers, stack_ptr).
- ⬜ Create a process list.

---

### Step 6.2: Context Switching *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** The mechanism to pause one process and start another.

**Action:**
- ⬜ In the Timer Interrupt handler, push all registers to the stack.
- ⬜ Save the current Stack Pointer to the current PCB.
- ⬜ Switch to the next PCB.
- ⬜ Pop registers and return from interrupt.

---

### Step 6.3: The AIOS Scheduler *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** Standard Round-Robin is okay, but we want AI priority.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Implement a Priority Queue.
- ⬜ Assign **high priority** to User Input (Keyboard).
- ⬜ Assign **lower priority** to Background Tasks (AI Inference).

---

## Phase 7: The AI Layer (The Brain)

**Goal:** Run the LLM locally.

### Step 7.1: SIMD/Math Setup *(1 Week)*

**Concept:** Enable AVX/SSE instructions in your OS.

**Action:**
- ⬜ Enable FPU/SSE during boot (set `CR0`/`CR4` registers).
- ⬜ Modify Context Switching to save FPU registers (`FXSAVE`).
- ⬜ Write a Matrix Multiplication function using Assembly AVX2 intrinsics.

---

### Step 7.2: Model Inference Engine *(3 Weeks)*

**Concept:** The core logic.

**Action:**
- ⬜ **Tokenization:** Port a simple BPE tokenizer to C (no standard lib).
- ⬜ **Loader:** Write code to load binary weights from your File System into contiguous memory (use your "Tensor Allocator" from Phase 3).
- ⬜ **Architecture:** Implement the Transformer layers (Dense layers, Softmax) in C.
- ⬜ **Run:** Load a tiny model (e.g., "TinyStories" or a small GPT-2 checkpoint).

---

### Step 7.3: The Chat Loop *(1 Week)*

**Action:**
1. ⬜ User types text.
2. ⬜ OS Tokenizes text.
3. ⬜ OS runs forward pass (Inference).
4. ⬜ OS prints predicted token to screen.
5. ⬜ Loop.

---

## Phase 8: User Interface (The Interaction)

**Goal:** A visual chat interface.

### Step 8.1: Graphics Mode *(2 Weeks)*

**Action:**
- ⬜ Request a Linear Frame Buffer (LFB) from the bootloader/UEFI.
- ⬜ Write a `put_pixel(x, y, color)` function.
- ⬜ Load a bitmap font and draw text characters pixel-by-pixel.

---

### Step 8.2: The Shell *(1 Week)*

**Action:**
- ⬜ Create a split screen: Top half for AI output, bottom half for user input.
- ⬜ Implement scrolling text rendering.
